  >> Switch-case statements used to compare the value of a variable with multiple values
  and execute some statements based on the match.
  >> Switch statement's expression must be evaluated to single value,
  it cannot be long, double, float and Boolean data type.
        *****SYNTAX*****
        switch (Data){
            case data1:
                Statement;
                break;
            case data2:
                Statement;
                break;
            default:
               Statement;
                break;

         BREAK: used for exiting the switch, if we don't give the break statement,
     Switch will continue to execute the next block until the break statement or } of the Switch
         DEFAULT BLOCK: get executed if none of the blocks are matched. There can be only one default block.
       - Switch statement cannot be used with <= >= etc.
       or any other boolean statement, it is only for conditional statements!

       - Switch statement is faster than if statement
       - Case value must match with the case
       - Long data type CANNOT be used with switch statement due to suffix L or l,
     same goes for float and double
       -BYTE, SHORT, CHAR, INT and STRING is accepted with Switch statement.
       - Value has to be SINGLE
