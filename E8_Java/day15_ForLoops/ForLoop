                               ******* FOR LOOP *******

 ### LOOPS ###
 - check condition
 - if condition returns true, a code block will run
 - the condition will be checked again and repeated until it turns false.
 - Types of Loop Statements
        1.For Loop
        2.While Loop
        3.do While

  1. FOR LOOP
  - Runs the given code specific number of times.
  - Initialization is the starting point of the loop
  - Condition is the ending point of the loop
  - Iterator is responsible for making the condition false.

  Syntax:
  for (initialization; condition; iteration){
    //Statements
  }
  - The initialization expression initializes the loop.
  - when the condition expression evaluates to false, loop stops running
  - the iteration gets executed after each iteration the loop.

    For Loop Flow
 1. initialization is executed >> the first time the loop is run the variable is assigned by value.
 2. after the initialization, the condition will be checked >> Everytime the loop is run, the condition is checked.
 3. as far as the condition is true , the next is the given statement check and execution of the code block within
 the loops body
 4. the last, iteration is executed until the condition turns to false >> when the code execution is finished
 within the curly braces, the iteration gets executed.
