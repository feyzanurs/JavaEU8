--------------- BRANCHING STATEMENTS ---------------------

1- BREAK

Causes the termination of the loop
tells interpreter to go on to the next statement of code outside of the loop.
    EX:
    Loop{
  statement1;
  statement2;
 |  break; (forcing the loop to stop)
 |   statement3;
 |   statement4;
 |   }
 |------->> jumps out of the loop, no matter how many cycles are left, loop is exited.


 2- CONTINUE

 Skips the current iteration of the loop and jumps to next iteration

    EX:
          >>> Loop{
         |   statement1'
         |   statement2;
         |   continue;
            statement3;   |
            statement4;   |---->> these statements are skipped
            }

  Branching statements:
  			break statement: exits the loop & switch
  			continue statement: skips the current iteration
