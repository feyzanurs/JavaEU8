                    WHILE LOOP
      ---------------------------------------
  - Repeated if statement
  - Condition is checked at start
  -Loop gets terminated when condition is false.

  SYNTAX:

  while(number<=5){ // test number as a boolean expression
  System.out.println("HELLO"); // if the boolean is true, perform these statements
  number++;
  } // while >> after executing the body of the loop, start over

  ** A for loop can be used if the number of repetition is known in advance
  ** A while loop can be used if the number of repetition is not fixed
  ** A do-while loop can be used to replace while loop id the loop body supposed to be executed before checking condition


                  DO  WHILE LOOP
      ---------------------------------------
      -Repeatedly executes same set of statement while condition is true.
      -The statement is executed once initially then condition is checked at loop end
      -Code in loop body will execute at least once

   SYNTAX:
   do{
   // loop body
   Statement ;
   } while (boolean expression){

   }

# while loop: repeated if statement #

	while(condition){
		statement;
	}

# do -while : JUST DO IT #

		do{
			statement;
		}while(condition);


# branching statements:#
			break statement: exits the loop & switch
			continue statement: skips the current iteration
